# Introduction

You currently know how to keep your data entries of interest, how keep relevant variables and how to modify them or create new ones.

Now, we will take your data wrangling skills one step further by understanding how to easily extract summary statistics, through the verb `summarize()`, such as calculating the mean of a variable.

Moreover, we will begin exploring a crucial verb, `group_by()`, capable of grouping your variables together to perform grouped operations on your data set.

Let's go !

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning objectives

1.  You can use `dplyr::summarize()` to extract summary statistics from datasets.

2.  You can use `dplyr::group_by()` to group data by one or more variables before performing operations on them.

3.  You understand why and how to ungroup grouped data frames.

4.  You can use `dplyr::n()` together with `group_by()`-`summarize()` to count rows per group.

5.  You can use `sum()` together with `group_by()`-`summarize()` to count rows that meet a condition.

# The Yaounde COVID-19 dataset

In this lesson, we will again use data from the COVID-19 serological survey conducted in Yaounde, Cameroon.

```{r, message = F}
yaounde <- read_csv(here::here('data/yaounde_data.csv'))

# A smaller subset of variables
yao <- yaounde %>% select(
  age, age_category_3, sex, weight_kg, height_cm,
  neighborhood, is_smoker, is_pregnant, occupation,
  treatment_combinations, symptoms, n_days_miss_work, n_bedridden_days,
  highest_education, igg_result)

yao
```

See the first lesson in this chapter for more information about this dataset.

# What are summary statistics?

A summary statistic is a single value (such as a mean or median) that describes a variable (typically a column in your dataset).

![](images/what_is_a_summary_statistic.png){width="363"}

Summary statistics can describe the center, spread or range of a variable, or the counts and positions of values within that variable. Some common summary statistics are shown in the diagram below:

![](images/summary_stats_examples.png){width="495"}

Computing summary statistics is a very common operation in most data analysis workflows, so it will be important to become fluent in extracting them from your datasets. And for this task, there is no better tool than the {dplyr} function `summarize()`! So let's see how to use this powerful function.

# Introducing `dplyr::summarize()`

To get started, it is best to first consider how to get simple summary statistics *without* using `summarize()`, then we will consider why you *should* actually use `summarize()`.

Imagine you were asked to find the mean age of respondents in the `yao` data frame. How might you do this in base R?

First, recall that the dollar sign function, `$`, allows you to extract a data frame column to a vector:

```{r eval = F}
yao$age # extract the `age` column from `yao`
```

To obtain the mean, you simply pass this `yao$age` vector into the `mean()` function:

```{r}
mean(yao$age)
```

And that's it! You now have a simple summary statistic. Extremely easy, right?

So why do we need `summarize()` to get summary statistics if the process is already so simple without it?We'll come back to the *why* question soon. First let's see *how* to obtain summary statistics with `summarize()`.

Going back to the previous example, the correct syntax to get the mean age with `summarize()` would be:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

The anatomy of this syntax is shown below. You simply need to input name of the new column (e.g. `mean_age`), the summary function (e.g. `mean()`), and the column to summarize (e.g. `age`).

![*Fig.* Basic syntax for the `summarize()` function.](images/summarize_syntax.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also compute multiple summary statistics in a single `summarize()` statement. For example, if you wanted both the mean and the median age, you could run:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), 
            median_age = median(age))
```

Nice!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, you should be wondering why `summarize()` puts the summary statistics into a data frame, with each statistic in a different column.

The main benefit of this data frame structure is to make it easy to produce *grouped* summaries (and creating such grouped summaries will be the primary benefit of using `summarize()`).

We will look at these grouped summaries in the next section. For now, attempt the practice questions below.

::: practice
Use `summarize()` and the relevant summary functions to obtain the mean, median and standard deviation of respondent weights from the `weight_kg` variable of the `yao` data frame.

Your output should be a data frame with three columns named as shown below:

| mean_weight_kg | median_weight_kg | sd_weight_kg |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
|                |                  |              |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_weight_summary <- 
  yao %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_weight_summary()
.HINT_Q_weight_summary()


# To get the solution, run the line below!
.SOLUTION_Q_weight_summary()
# Each question has a solution function similar to this.
# (Where HINT is replaced with SOLUTION in the function name.)
# But you will need to type out the function name on your own.
# (This is to discourage you from looking at the solution before answering the question.)
```
:::

::: practice
Use `summarize()` and the relevant summary functions to obtain the minimum and maximum respondent heights from the `height_cm` variable of the `yao` data frame.

Your output should be a data frame with two columns named as shown below:

| min_height_cm | max_height_cm |
|---------------|---------------|
|               |               |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_height_summary <- 
  yao %>% 
  ____________________________
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_height_summary()
.HINT_Q_height_summary()
```
:::

# Grouped summaries with `dplyr::group_by()`

As its name suggests, `dplyr::group_by()` lets you group a data frame by the values in a variable (e.g. male vs female sex). You can then perform operations that are split according to these groups.

What effect does `group_by()` have on a data frame? Let's try to group the `yao` data frame by sex and observe the effect:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex)
```

Hmm. Apparently nothing happened. The one thing you *might* notice is a new section in the header that tells you the grouped-by variable---sex---and the number of groups---2:

      # A tibble: 971 Ã— 10
    ðŸ‘‰# Groups:   sex [2]ðŸ‘ˆ

Apart from this header however, the data frame appears unchanged.

But watch what happens when we chain the `group_by()` with the `summarize()` call we used in the previous section:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

You get a different summary statistic for each group! The statistics for women are in one row and those for men are in another. (From this output data frame, you can tell that, for example, the mean age for female respondents is 29.5, while that for male respondents is 28.4)

As was mentioned earlier, this kind of grouped summary is the primary reason the `summarize()` function is so useful!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see another example of a simple `group_by()` + `summarize()` operation.

Suppose you were asked to obtain the maximum and minimum weights for individuals in different neighborhoods in the `yao` data frame. First you would `group_by()` the `neighbourhood` variable, then call the `max()` and `min()` functions inside `summarize()`:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(max_weight = max(weight_kg), 
            min_weight = min(weight_kg))
```

Great! With just a few code lines you are able to extract quite a lot of information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see one more example for good measure. The variable `n_days_miss_work` tells us the number of days that respondents missed work due to COVID-like symptoms. Individuals who reported no COVID-like symptoms have an `NA` for this variable:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  select(n_days_miss_work)
```

To count the total number of work days missed for each sex group, you could try to run the `sum()` function on the `n_days_miss_work` variable:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(total_days_missed = sum(n_days_miss_work))
```

Hmmm. This gives you `NA` results because some rows in the `n_days_miss_work` column have `NA`s in them, and R cannot find the sum of values containing an `NA`. To solve this, the argument `na.rm = TRUE` is needed:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(total_days_missed = sum(n_days_miss_work, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The output tells us that across all women in the sample, 256 work days were missed due to COVID-like symptoms, and across all men, 272 days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So hopefully now you see why `summarize()` is so powerful. In combination with `group_by()`, it lets you obtain highly informative grouped summaries of your datasets with very few lines of code.

Producing such summaries is a very important part of most data analysis workflows, so this skill is likely to come in handy soon!

# Grouping by multiple variables (nested grouping)

It is possible to group a data frame by more than one variable. This is sometimes called "nested" grouping.

Let's see an example. Suppose you want to know the mean age of men and women *in each neighbourhood* (rather than the mean age of *all* women), you could put both `sex` and `neighborhood` in the `group_by()` statement:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

From this output data frame you can tell that, for example, women from Briqueterie have a mean age of 31.6 years, while men from Briqueterie have a mean age of 33.7 years.

The order of the columns listed in `group_by()` is interchangeable. So if you run `group_by(neighborhood, sex)` instead of `group_by(sex, neighborhood)`, you'll get the same result, although it will be ordered differently:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood, sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

Now the column order is different: `neighborhood` is the first column, and `sex` is the second. And the row order is also different: rows are first ordered by `neighborhood`, then ordered by `sex` within each neighborhood.

But the actual summary statistics are the same. For example, you can again see that women from Briqueterie have a mean age of 31.6 years, while men from Briqueterie have a mean age of 33.7 years.

::: practice
Using the `yao` data frame, group your data by gender (`sex`) and treatments (`treatment_combinations`) using `group_by`. Then, using `summarize()` and the relevant summary function, calculate the mean weight (`weight_kg`) for each group.

| sex | treatment_combinations | mean_weight_kg |
|-----|------------------------|----------------|
|     |                        |                |

Using the `yao` data frame, group your data by age category (`age_category_3`), gender (`sex`), and IgG results (`igg_result`) using `group_by`. Then, using `summarize()` and the relevant summary function, calculate the mean number of bedridden days (`n_bedridden_days`) for each group.

Your output should be a data frame with four columns named as shown below:

| age_category_3 | sex | igg_result | mean_n\_bedridden_days |
|----------------|-----|------------|------------------------|
|                |     |            |                        |

# Ungrouping with `dplyr::ungroup()` (why and how)

When you `group_by()` more than one variable before using `summarize()`, the output data frame is still grouped. This persistent grouping can have unwanted downstream effects, so you will sometimes need to use `dplyr::ungroup()` to ungroup the data before doing further analysis.

To understand *why* you should `ungroup()` data, first consider the following example, where we group by only one variable before summarizing:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

The data comes out like a normal data frame; it is not grouped. You can tell this because there is no information about groups in the header.

But now consider when you group by two variables before summarizing:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age))
```

Now the header tells you that the data is still grouped by the first variable in `group_by()`, sex:

      # A tibble: 18 Ã— 3
    ðŸ‘‰# Groups:   sex [2]ðŸ‘ˆ

What is the implication of this persistent grouping in the data frame? It means that the data frame may exhibit what seems like weird behavior when you try to apply some {dplyr} functions on it.

For example, if you try to `select()` a single variable, perhaps the `mean_age` variable, you should normally be able to just use `select(mean_age)`:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  select(mean_age) # doesn't work as expected 
```

But as you can see, the grouped-by variable, `sex`, is *still* selected, even though we only asked for `mean_age` in the `select()` statement.

This is one of the many examples of unique behaviors of grouped data frames. Other dplyr verbs like `filter()`, `mutate()` and `arrange()` also act in special ways on grouped data. We will address this in detail in a future lesson.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you now know *why* you should ungroup data when you no longer need it grouped. Let's now see *how* to ungroup data. It's quite simple: just add the `ungroup()` function to your pipe chain. For example:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Now that the data frame is ungrouped, it will behave like a normal data frame again. For example, you can `select()` any column(s) you want; you won't have some unwanted columns tagging along:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(mean_age)
```

# Counting rows

> You can do a lot of data science by just *counting* and occasionally *dividing.* - Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio

A common data summarization task is counting how many observations (rows) there are for each group. You can achieve this with the special `n()` function from {dplyr}, which is specifically designed to be used within `summarise()`.

For example, if you want to count how many individuals are in each neighborhood group, you would run:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
```

As you can see, the `n()` function does not require any arguments. It just "knows its job" in the data frame!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, you can include other summary statistics in the same `summarize()` call. For example, below we also calculate the mean age per neighborhood.

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), 
            mean_age = mean(age))

```

::: practice
Group your `yao` data frame by the respondents' occupation (`occupation`) and use `summarize()` to create columns that show:

-   how many individuals there are with each occupation (think of the `n()` function)
-   the mean number of work days missed (`n_days_miss_work`) by those in that occupation

Your output should be a data frame with three columns named as shown below:

| occupation | count | mean_n\_days_miss_work |
|------------|-------|------------------------|
|            |       |                        |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_occupation_summary <- 
  yao %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_occupation_summary()
.HINT_Q_occupation_summary()
```
:::

## Counting rows that meet a condition

Rather than counting *all* rows as above, it is sometimes more useful to count just the rows that meet specific conditions. This can be done easily by placing the required conditions within the `sum()` function.

For example, to count the number of people under 18 in each neighborhood, you place the condition `age < 18` inside `sum()`:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(count_under_18 = sum(age < 18))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, to count the number of people with doctorate degrees in each neighborhood, you place the condition `highest_education == "Doctorate"` inside `sum()`:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(count_with_doctorates = sum(highest_education == "Doctorate"))
```

::: challenge
**Under the hood: counting with conditions**

Why are you able to use `sum()` which is meant to add numbers, on a condition like `highest_education == "Doctorate"`?

Using `sum()` on a condition works because the condition evaluates to the Boolean values `TRUE` and `FALSE`. And these Boolean values are treated as numbers (where `TRUE` equals 1 and `FALSE` equals 0), and numbers can, of course, be summed.

The code below demonstrates what is going on under the hood in a step-by-step way. Run through it and see if you can follow.

```{r}
demo_of_condition_sums <- yao %>% 
  select(highest_education) %>% 
  mutate(with_doctorate = highest_education == "Doctorate") %>% 
  mutate(numeric_with_doctorate = as.numeric(with_doctorate))

demo_of_condition_sums
```

The numeric values can then be added to produce a count of rows fulfilling the condition `highest_education == "Doctorate"`:

```{r}
demo_of_condition_sums %>% 
  summarize(count_with_doctorate = sum(numeric_with_doctorate))
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a final illustration of counting with conditions, consider the `treatment_combinations` variable, which lists the treatments received by people with COVID-like symptoms. People who received no treatments have an `NA` value:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  select(treatment_combinations)
```

If you want to count the number of people who received *no treatment*, you would sum up those who meet the `is.na(treatment_combinations)` condition:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(unknown_treatments = sum(is.na(treatment_combinations)))
```

These are the people with `NA` values for the `treatment_combinations` column.

To count the people who *did* receive some treatment, you can simply negate the `is.na()` function with `!`:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(known_treatments = sum(!is.na(treatment_combinations)))
```

::: practice
Group your `yao` data frame by the respondents' symptoms (`symptoms`) and use the `sum()` function to count how many adults have each symptom combination.

Your output should be a data frame with two columns named as shown below:

| symptoms | sum_adults |
|----------|------------|
|          |            |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_symptoms_adults <-
  yao %>%
  group_by(GROUPED VARIABLE HERE) %>% 
  summarise(sum_adults = sum(HERE, INPUT A CONDITION TO MATCH ADULTS))
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_symptoms_adults()
.HINT_Q_symptoms_adults()
```
:::

## dplyr::count()

The `dplyr::count()` function wraps a bunch of things into one beautiful friendly line of code to help you find counts of observations by group.

Let's use `dplyr::count()` on our `occupation` variable:

```{r}
yao %>%
  count(occupation)
```

Note that this is the same output as:

```{r}
yao %>%
  group_by(occupation) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

You can also apply `dplyr::count()` in a nested fashion:

```{r}
yao %>%
  count(sex, occupation)
```

::: practice
The `count()` verb gives you key information about your dataset in a very quick manner. Let's look at our IgG results stratified by age category and sex in one line of code.

Using the `yao` data frame, count the different combinations of gender (`sex`), age categories (`age_category_3`) and IgG results (`igg_result`).

Your output should be a data frame with four columns named as shown below:

| sex | age_category_3 | igg_result | n   |
|-----|----------------|------------|-----|
|     |                |            |     |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_count_iggresults_stratified_by_sex_agecategories <- 
  yao %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_count_iggresults_stratified_by_sex_agecategories()
.HINT_Q_count_iggresults_stratified_by_sex_agecategories()
```

Using the `yao` data frame, count the different combinations of age categories (`age_category_3`) and number of bedridden days (`n_bedridden_days`).

Your output should be a data frame with three columns named as shown below:

| age_category_3 | n_bedridden_days | n   |
|----------------|------------------|-----|
|                |                  |     |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_count_bedridden_age_categories <- 
  yao %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_count_bedridden_age_categories()
.HINT_Q_count_bedridden_age_categories()
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The downside of `count()` is that it can only give you a single summary statistic in the data frame. When you use `summarize()` and `n()` you can include multiple summary statistics. For example:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), 
            median_age = median(age))
```

But `count()` can only yield counts:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, neighborhood) %>% 
  count()
```

# Including missing combinations in summaries

When you use `group_by()` and `summarize()` on multiple variables, you obtain a summary statistic for every unique combination of the grouped variables. For instance, consider the code and output below, which counts the number of individuals in each age-sex group:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_category_3) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n()) 
```

In the output data frame, there is one row for each combination of sex and age group (Female---Adult, Female---Child and so on).

But what happens if one of these combinations is not present in the data?

Let's create an artificial example to observe this. With the code below, we artificially drop all male children from the `yao` data frame:

```{r}
yao_no_male_children <- 
  yao %>% 
  filter(!(sex == "Male" & age_category_3 == "Child"))
```

Now if you run the same `group_by()` and `summarize()` call on `yao_no_male_children`, you'll notice the missing combination:

```{r}
yao_no_male_children %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_category_3) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n())
```

Indeed, there is no row for male children.

But sometimes it is useful to include such missing combinations in the output data frame, with an `NA` or 0 value for the summary statistic.

To do this, you can run the following code instead:

```{r}
yao_no_male_children %>% 
  # convert variables to factors
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex), 
         age_category_3 = as.factor(age_category_3)) %>% 
  # Note the the .drop = FALSE argument
  group_by(sex, age_category_3, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n())
```

What does the code do?

-   First it converts the grouping variables to factors with `as.factor()` (inside a `mutate()` call)

-   Then it uses the argument `.drop = FALSE` in the `group_by()` function to avoid dropping the missing combinations.

Now you have a clear `0` count for the number of male children!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see one more example, this time without artificially modifying our data.

The code below calculates the average age by sex and education group:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  group_by(sex, highest_education) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
```

Notice that in the output data frame, there are 7 rows for men but only 6 rows for women, because no woman answered "Other" to the question on highest education level.

If you nonetheless want to include the "Female---Other" row in the output data frame, you would run:

```{r}
yao %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex), 
         highest_education = as.factor(highest_education)) %>% 
  group_by(sex, highest_education, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))
```

::: practice
Using the `yao` data frame, let's calculate the median age when grouping by neighborhood, age_category, and gender

Note, we want all possible combinations of these three variables (not just those present in our data).

Pay attention to two data wrangling imperatives!

-   convert your grouping variables to factors beforehand using `mutate()`
-   calculate your statistic, the median, while removing any `NA` values.

Your output should be a data frame with four columns named as shown below:

| neighborhood | age_category_3 | sex | median_age |
|--------------|----------------|-----|------------|
|              |                |     |            |

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_median_age_by_neighborhood_agecategory_sex <- 
  yao %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_median_age_by_neighborhood_agecategory_sex()
.HINT_Q_median_age_by_neighborhood_agecategory_sex()
```

::: side-note
**Why include missing combinations?**

Above, we mentioned that including missing combinations is often useful in the data analysis workflow. Let's see one use case: plotting with {ggplot}. If you have not yet learned {ggplot}, that is okay, just focus on the plot outputs.

To make a dodged bar chart with the age-sex counts of `yao_no_male_children`, you could run:

```{r}
yao_no_male_children %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_category_3) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # pass the output to ggplot
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = sex, y = number_of_individuals, fill = age_category_3), 
           position = "dodge")
```

Not very elegant! Ideally there should be an empty space indicating 0 for the number of male children.

If you instead implement the procedure to include missing combinations, you get a more natural dodged bar plot, with an empty space for male children:

```{r}
yao_no_male_children %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex), 
         age_category_3 = as.factor(age_category_3)) %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_category_3, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # pass the output to ggplot
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = sex, y = number_of_individuals, fill = age_category_3), 
           position = "dodge")
```

Much better!

By the way, this output can be improved slightly by setting the factor levels for age to their proper ascending order: first "Child", then "Adult" then "Senior":

```{r}
yao_no_male_children %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex), 
         age_category_3 = factor(age_category_3, 
                                 levels = c("Child", 
                                            "Adult", 
                                            "Senior"))) %>% 
  group_by(sex, age_category_3, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_individuals = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # pass the output to ggplot
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = sex, y = number_of_individuals, fill = age_category_3), 
           position = "dodge")
```

# Wrap-up

You have now seen how to obtain quick summary statistics from your data, either for exploratory data or for further data presentation or plotting.

Additionally, you have discovered one of the marvels of {dplyr}, the possibility to group your data using `group_by()`.

`group_by()` combined with `summarize()` is a one of the most common grouping manipulations.

![Fig: summarize() and group_by()](images/custom_dplyr_groupby_summarize.png){alt="Fig: summarize() and its use combined with group_by()." width="400"}

However, you can also combine `group_by()` with many of the other {dplyr} verbs: this is what we will cover in our next lesson. See you soon !
