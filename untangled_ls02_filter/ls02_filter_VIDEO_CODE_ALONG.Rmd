# Data wrangling: filtering rows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning objectives

1.  You will use `dplyr::filter()` to keep or drop rows from a dataframe.

2.  You will filter rows by specifying conditions on numbers or strings using relational operators like greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), equal to (`==`), and not equal to (`!=`).

3.  You will filter rows by combining conditions using logical operators like the ampersand (`&`) and the vertical bar (`|`).

4.  You will filter rows by negating conditions using the exclamation mark (`!`) logical operator.

5.  You will filter rows with missing values using the `is.na()` function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Yaounde COVID-19 dataset

We continue to use the data from the COVID-19 serological survey from Yaounde.

```{r, message = F}
yaounde <- read_csv(here::here('data/yaounde_data.csv'))
## a smaller subset of variables
yao <- yaounde %>% 
  select(age, sex, weight_kg, highest_education, neighborhood, 
         occupation, is_smoker, is_pregnant, 
         igg_result, igm_result)
yao
```

## Introducing `filter()`

We use `filter()` to keep rows that satisfy a set of conditions.

Let's take a look at a simple example.

If we want to keep just the male records, we run:

```{r}
yao ____________________ # Filter for sex equal to "Male"
```

Note the use of the double equal sign `==` rather than the single equal sign `=`.

We can chain `filter()` with `nrow()` to get the number of rows fulfilling a condition.

```{r, render = normal_print}
## how many respondents were male?
yao %>% 
  _______________________ %>% 
  _________________
```

::: key-point
The double equal sign, `==`, tests for equality,

while the single equals sign, `=`, is used for specifying values to arguments inside functions.
:::

::: practice
Filter the `yao` data frame to respondents who were pregnant during the survey.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# For this first practice question we'll provide the answer.
# Run this chunk, then run the CHECK and HINT functions in the code chunks further down
Q_is_pregnant<- yao %>% filter(is_pregnant == "Yes")
Q_is_pregnant
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_is_pregnant()
.HINT_Q_is_pregnant()
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Now, to obtain the solution, run the line below!
.SOLUTION_Q_is_pregnant()
# Each question has a solution function similar to this.
# (Where HINT is replaced with SOLUTION in the function name.)
# But you will need to type out the function name on your own.
# (This is to discourage you from looking at the solution before answering the question.)
```

How many respondents were female? (Use `filter()` and `nrow()`)

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_female_nrow <- yao ______________________
Q_female_nrow
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_female_nrow()
.HINT_Q_female_nrow()
```
:::

## Relational operators

The `==` operator introduced above is an example of a "relational" operator

Here is a list of some of these operators.

|              |                                     |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------|
| **Operator** | **is TRUE if**                      |
| A \< B       | A is **less than** B                |
| A \<= B      | A is **less than or equal** to B    |
| A \> B       | A is **greater than** B             |
| A \>= B      | A is **greater than or equal to** B |
| A == B       | A is **equal** to B                 |
| A != B       | A is **not equal** to B             |
| A %in% B     | A **is an element of** B            |

![Fig: AND and OR operators visualized.](images/venn_diagram_and_or.png){width="450"}

Let's see how to use these within `filter()`:

```{r}
yao %>% filter(____________) ## keep rows where `sex` is not "Male"
yao %>% filter(____________) ## keep respondents under 6
yao %>% filter(____________) ## keep respondents aged at least 70

## keep respondents whose highest education is "Primary" or "Secondary"
yao %>% filter(___________________________________)
```

::: practice
From `yao`, keep only respondents who were children (under 18).

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_under_18 <- yao _______________________
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_under_18()
.HINT_Q_under_18()
```

With `%in%`, keep only respondents who live in the "Tsinga" or "Messa" neighborhoods.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_tsinga_messa <- yao _______________________
Q_tsinga_messa
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_tsinga_messa()
.HINT_Q_tsinga_messa()
```
:::

## Combining conditions with `&` and `|`

A single `filter()` statement can encompass multiple conditions.

The conditions are separated by commas:

```{r}
## keep respondents who are pregnant and are ex-smokers
yao %>% filter(_____________________________________) ## only one row
```

When multiple conditions are separated by a comma, they are implicitly combined with an **and** (`&`).

Good practice is to replace the comma with `&` to make this more explicit.

```{r}
## same result as before, but `&` is more explicit
yao %>% filter(_____________________________________)
```

::: side-note
Don't confuse:

-   the "," in listing several conditions in filter `filter(A,B)` i.e. filter based on condition A and (`&`) condition B

-   the "," in lists `c(A,B)` which is listing different components of the list (and has nothing to do with the `&` operator)
:::

If we want to combine conditions with an **or**, we use the vertical bar symbol, `|`.

```{r}
## respondents who are pregnant OR who are ex-smokers
yao %>% filter(___________________________________________)
```

::: practice

Filter `yao` to only keep men who tested IgG positive.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_male_positive <- yao %>% ____________________
Q_male_positive
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_male_positive()
.HINT_Q_male_positive()
```

Filter `yao` to keep both children (under 18) and anyone whose highest education is primary school.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_child_primary <- yao %>% ____________________
Q_child_primary
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_child_primary()
.HINT_Q_child_primary()
```
:::

## Negating conditions with `!`

To negate conditions, we wrap them in `!()`.

Below, we drop respondents:

-   who are children (less than 18 years)

OR

-   who weigh less than 30kg:

```{r}
## drop respondents < 18 years OR < 30 kg
yao %>% filter(_________________________)
```

If you combine `!` with `%in%` then it is like writing the operator **NOT in**:

```{r}
## drop respondents whose highest education is NOT "Primary" or "Secondary"
yao %>% filter(!(highest_education %in% c("Primary", "Secondary")))

```

::: key-point
It is easier to read `filter()` statements as **keep** statements,

to avoid confusion over whether we are filtering **in** or filtering **out**!

So the code below would read: "**keep** respondents who are under 18 or who weigh less than 30kg".

```{r, eval = F}
yao %>% filter(age < 18 | weight_kg < 30)
```

And when we wrap conditions in `!()`, we can then read `filter()` statements as **drop** statements.

So the code below would read: "**drop** respondents who are under 18 or who weigh less than 30kg".

```{r, eval = F}
yao %>% filter(!(age < 18 | weight_kg < 30))
```
:::

::: practice
From `yao`, drop respondents who live in the Tsinga or Messa neighborhoods.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_not_tsinga_messa <- yao ____________
Q_not_tsinga_messa
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_not_tsinga_messa()
.HINT_Q_not_tsinga_messa()
```
:::

## `NA` values

The relational operators introduced so far do not work with `NA`.

Let's make a data subset to illustrate this.

```{r}
yao_mini <- yao %>% 
  select(sex, is_pregnant) %>% 
  slice(1,11,50,2) ## custom row order

yao_mini
```

In `yao_mini`, the last respondent has an `NA` for the `is_pregnant` column, because he is male.

Trying to select this row using `== NA` will not work.

```{r}
yao_mini %>% filter(is_pregnant == NA) ## does not work
yao_mini %>% filter(is_pregnant == "NA") ## does not work
```

`NA` is a non-existent value.

So R cannot evaluate whether it is "equal to" or "not equal to" anything.

The special function `is.na()` is therefore necessary:

```{r}
## keep rows where `is_pregnant` is NA
yao_mini %>% filter(____________________) 
```

This function can be negated with `!`:

```{r}
## drop rows where `is_pregnant` is NA
yao_mini %>% filter(____________________)
```

This is super useful to remove any `NA` values from your variables. More on this in the future.

::: side-note
For tibbles, RStudio will highlight `NA` values bright red to distinguish them from other values:

![A common error with `NA`](images/tibble_with_na.png){width="200"}
:::

::: side-note
`NA` values can be identified but any other encoding such as `"NA"` or `"NaN"`, which are encoded as strings, will be imperceptible to the functions (they are strings, like any others).
:::

::: practice
From the `yao` dataset, keep all the respondents who had missing records for the report of their smoking status.

```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
Q_na_smoker <- yao %>% _____________________
Q_na_smoker
```


```{r, eval = F, echo = FALSE}
# Check your answer:
.CHECK_Q_na_smoker()
.HINT_Q_na_smoker()
```
