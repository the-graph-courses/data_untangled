## Intro {.unnumbered}

In previous lessons, you learned how to perform a range of wrangling operations like filtering, mutating and summarizing. But so far, you only performed these operations *one column at a time*. Sometimes however, it will be useful (and efficient) to apply the same operation to *several columns at the same time*. For this, the `across()` function can be used.

Let's see how!

![Fig: the `across()` verb.](../images/custom_dplyr_across.png){width="400"}

## Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

1.  You can use `across()` with the `mutate()` and `summarize()` verbs to apply operations over multiple columns.

2.  You can use the `.names` argument within `mutate(across())` to create new columns.

3.  You can write anonymous (lambda) functions within `across()`

## Packages

This lesson will require the packages loaded below:

```{r}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(here, tidyverse)
```

## Datasets

In this lesson, we will again use data from the COVID-19 serological survey conducted in Yaounde, Cameroon.

```{r, message = F}
yaounde <- read_csv(here("ch04_data_wrangling/data/yaounde_data.csv"))

yaounde <- yaounde %>% rename(age_years = age)

yaounde
```

We will also use data from a hospital [study](https://zenodo.org/record/4541793) conducted in Burkina Faso, in which a range of clinical data was collected from patients with febrile (fever-causing) diseases, with the aim of predicting the cause of the fever.

```{r, message = F}
febrile_diseases <- read_csv(here("ch04_data_wrangling/data/febrile_diseases_burkina_faso.csv"))
febrile_diseases
```

Finally, we will use data from a dietary diversity [survey](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NRNCX0) conducted in Vietnam, in which women were asked to recall (one or several days) the foods and drinks they consumed the previous day.

```{r, message = F}
diet <- read_csv(here("ch04_data_wrangling/data/vietnam_diet_diversity.csv"))
diet <- diet %>% rename(household_id = hhid)

diet
```

## Using `across()` with `mutate()`

The `mutate()` function gives you an easy way to create new variables or modify in place variables.

But sometimes you have a large number of columns to operate on, and typing out `mutate()` statements line-by-line can become onerous. In such cases `across()` can radically simplify and shorten your code.

Let's see an example.

Consider the symptoms columns (from `symp_fever` to `symp_stomach_ache`) in the `yaounde` data frame:

```{r}
yao_symptoms <- 
  yaounde %>% 
  select(age_years, sex, date_surveyed, symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache)

yao_symptoms 
```

The **13 columns** between `symp_fever` and `symp_stomach_ache` indicate whether or not each respondent had a specific COVID-compatible symptom.

Now, imagine you wanted to convert all these columns to upper case. (That is, "Yes" to "YES" and "No" to "NO"). How might you do this? Without `across()`, you would have to mutate the columns one by one, with the `toupper()` function:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(symp_fever = toupper(symp_fever),
         symp_headache = toupper(symp_headache),
         symp_cough = toupper(symp_cough), 
         symp_rhinitis = toupper(symp_rhinitis), 
         symp_sneezing = toupper(symp_sneezing),
         symp_fatigue = toupper(symp_fatigue),
         symp_muscle_pain = toupper(symp_muscle_pain)
         #... And on and on and on and on and on
         )
```

This is obviously not very time-efficient. An experienced data analyst who saw this code might scold you for not obeying the **DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself") principle of programming**.

But with the `across()` function, you have the power to do this in all of two lines:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = toupper))
```

Amazing!

Let's break down the code above. We used `across()` inside of the `mutate()` function, and provided it with two main arguments:

-   `.cols` defined the *columns* to be modified. The `symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache` code means "all columns between `symp_fever` and `symp_stomach_ache`".

-   `.fns` defined the *functions* to apply on the selected columns. In this case, the `toupper` function was applied.

And that's the basic gist of `across()`! But below we'll consider each of these arguments in a bit more detail.

::: side-note
**Why follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle?**

There are many reasons to avoid repetitive code. Here are just a few:

1.  You'll save time in writing the code (obviously).
2.  You'll also save time in *maintaining* the code. This is because if you need to make a change (e.g. switch `toupper` to `tolower`), you won't need to make the same change in several places. You can fix it in a single place.
3.  DRY code is usually easier to read and understand, both by yourself and by others.
:::

### The `.cols` argument

Now let's look at the arguments of `across()` in some more detail.

As mentioned above, the `.cols` argument of `across()` selects the columns to be modified.

Most the different methods you have learned for selecting columns can be used here.

One difference with the classical use of `select()` is that to list column names with `across()`, you must wrap them in `c()`:

```{r eval = F}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = c(symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough),
                .fns = toupper))
```

If, instead of `c(symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough)` you just put in `symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough,` you'll get an error:

```{r eval = F}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough, # Don't do this
                .fns = toupper))
```

    Error in `mutate()`:
    ! Problem while computing `..1 = across(.cols = symp_fever, symp_headache....

Other than that, the usual variable selection methods can be used here.

So you can use numeric ranges, like `4:16`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = 4:16,
                .fns = toupper))
```

Or helper verbs like `starts_with()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = starts_with("symp_"),
                .fns = toupper))
```

Or the function `where()` to select columns of a particular type:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.character),
                .fns = toupper))
```

Or the catch-all `everything()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = everything(),
                .fns = toupper))
```

Note that `everything()` is the default value for the .`cols`. So the above code, is equivalent to simply running:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = toupper))
```

::: practice
In the `febrile_diseases` dataset, the columns from `abd_pain` to `splenomegaly` indicate whether a patient had a specified symptom, recorded as "yes" or "no".

```{r}
febrile_diseases %>% 
  select(abd_pain:splenomegaly)
```

Use `mutate()` and `across()` to convert the variable levels to uppercase. (That is, "yes" to "YES" and "no" to "NO")

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_febrile_disease_symptoms <- 
  febrile_diseases %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms()
.HINT_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms()
```
:::

### The `.fns` argument

Now, on to the second argument in `across()`. As mentioned above, this argument takes in the function to be applied across columns.

You can provide any valid function here. We had previously used `toupper()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = toupper))
```

In a similar style, we can also use `tolower()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = tolower))
```

Of course, the function we apply through `across()` needs to be **type-appropriate**: it should apply to the type (character, numeric, factor, etc) of the variables we are feeding in.

```{r eval = FALSE}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = log))
```

    Error in `mutate()`:
    ! non-numeric argument to mathematical function

Here we get an error message because we tried to apply a function made for numeric variables to character type variables.

::: side-note
It is a bit confusing to write a function without parentheses, as in `.fns = toupper`. There is a difference between `toupper()` and `toupper`.

`toupper()` calls the function, while `toupper` without parenthesis makes a reference to the function. With a reference to the function, `across()` will take care of calling it from its back-end code (the code that defines `across()`. We call it "back-end" because it's "in the back" and you cannot see it unless you go looking into it explicitly.)
:::

::: practice
In the `febrile_diseases` dataset, ensure that all the columns from `abd_pain` to `splenomegaly`, indicating symptoms of patients, are in lower case. Apply `tolower()` across all these variables using `mutate()` and `across()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_lower <- 
  febrile_diseases %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_lower()
.HINT_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_lower()
```
:::

### Custom ("anonymous") functions

Sometimes it is useful to use a custom function, called a "lambda function" or "anonymous function". You will see more about functions in later lessons. The idea here is that you write your own operation which will be applied across your selected variables. The writing of these lambda functions has certain strict rules so pay attention to this as we go through several examples.

The `toupper` example we saw above can be rewritten with this syntax:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ toupper(.x)))
```

In the code `.fns = ~ toupper(.x)`, the tilda, `~`, introduces the lambda function, and the `.x` references each of the columns across which you are applying the function. The `.x` takes the columns one by one and "calls" the function on each one.

So overall, this code can be read as "apply `toupper()` to each of the symptom variables."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is another example, but with `tolower()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ tolower(.x)))
```

The pattern is quite simple once you get used to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, with this anonymous function syntax, it becomes very intuitive to use functions that take in multiple arguments.

For example, we could explicit the "No" and "Yes" by pasting into the string what they are referring to, in other words, symptoms:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ paste0(.x, " symptoms")))
```

Or we could use `str_sub()`, a function that allows to keep a subset of your string:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ str_sub(.x, start = 1, end = 1)))
```

In our case our string values are "No" and "Yes" so we will make a substring with just their first letters ("N" and "Y") to have a **one letter encoding**.

Or we can recode the "Yes" and "No" entries in a different manner:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", "Has symptom", "Does not have symptom")))
```

Now we have the "Yes" encoded as "Has symptom" and the "No" encoded as "Does not have symptom". These strings are longer but they are clearer in their meaning than just "Yes" vs. "No".

We could also recode the "Yes" and "No" to numeric values:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", 1, 2)))
```

Now we have "Yes" encoded as choice 1 and "No" as 2.

Note that you can chain several `mutate()` calls together:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", 1, 2))) %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache,
                .fns = ~ case_when(.x == 1 ~ 1,
                                   .x == 2 ~ 0)))
```

Above, we first convert from "Yes" & "No" to the numeric values 1 and 2, to follow R indexing (R counts from 1 onwards). However, other programming language start their index at 0, such as Python (Python counts from 0 onwards). For many machine learning algorithms, your encoding should be 0 or 1, so this could be a useful conversion of the encoding of your data. We use `case_when()` to define which numerical value should be switched to 1 (TRUE, has symptoms) and which numerical value should be switched to 0 (FALSE, does not have symptoms).

::: practice
The columns from `abd_pain` to `splenomegaly` in the `febrile_diseases` dataset contain information on whether a patient had a specified symptom, recorded as "yes" or "no".

Use `mutate()`, `across()` and an anonymous function to convert the variable levels to numbers, with "yes" as 1 and "no" as 0.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric <- 
  febrile_diseases %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric()
.HINT_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric()
```
:::

::: practice
In the `diet` dataset, the columns from `retinol` to `zinc` give the number of milligrams of each nutrient consumed by the surveyed women in a day.

```{r}
diet %>%
  select(retinol:zinc)
```

Use `mutate()`, `across()` and an anonymous function to convert these values to grams (divide by 1000).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_diet_to_grams <- 
  diet %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_diet_to_grams()
.HINT_Q_diet_to_grams()
```
:::

### Creating new columns with the `.names` argument

The examples we have seen so far all involved replacing existing columns.

But what if you want to create new columns instead?

To illustrate this, let's create a smaller subset of `yao_symptoms`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini <- 
  yao_symptoms %>% 
  select(symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough) 

yao_symptoms_mini
```

Now, to convert all columns to uppercase, we would usually run:

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = toupper))
```

This code modifies existing columns *in place*

(Remember that the default argument for `.cols` is `everything()`, so the above code modifies all columns in the dataset)

Now, if we instead want to make *new* columns that are uppercase, we can use the `.names` argument of `across()`

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = toupper, 
                .names = "{.col}_uppercase"))
```

`{.col}` represents each of the old column names. The rest of the string. "\_uppercase" is pasted together with the old column names. So the code `"{.col}_uppercase"` code can be read as "for each column, convert to uppercase and name it by pasting the existing lowercase column name with \_uppercase."

Of course, we can input any arbitrary string:

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = toupper, 
                .names = "{.col}_BIG_LETTERS"))
```

If we want the text to come before the old column name, we can also do this:

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = toupper, 
                .names = "uppercase_{.col}"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

More usefully, we can create a numeric version of these symptoms variables:

```{r}
yao_symptoms_mini %>% 
  mutate(across(.fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", 1, 0), 
                .names = "numeric_{.col}"))
```

::: practice
Now you will convert again the columns from `abd_pain` to `splenomegaly` in the `febrile_diseases` dataset, on patient symptoms, into numerical values. But, you will create new columns named `numeric_abd_pain` to `numeric_splenomegaly` using the `.names` argument within `across()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric_new_variables <- 
  febrile_diseases %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric_new_variables()
.HINT_Q_febrile_disease_symptoms_to_numeric_new_variables()
```
:::

## Using `across()` with `summarize()`

To get summary statistics over multiple variables it is often helpful to use `across()`.

Consider again the columns from `retinol` to `zinc` in the `diet` dataset, which indicate the number of milligrams of each nutrient consumed by surveyed Vietnamese women in a day:

```{r}
diet %>% 
  select(retinol:zinc)
```

Imagine you wanted to find the average amount of each nutrient consumed. To do this the usual way, you would need to type:

```{r}
diet %>% 
  summarize(mean_retinol = mean(retinol), 
            mean_alpha_catorene = mean(alpha_catorene), 
            mean_beta_catorene = mean(beta_catorene), 
            mean_vitamin_c = mean(vitamin_c), 
            mean_vitamin_b2 = mean(vitamin_b2)
            # And on and on and on for 15 columns
            )
```

Of course this is not very efficient.

But with `across()`, this can be done in just two lines:

```{r}
diet %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = retinol:zinc, 
                   .fns = mean))
```

And recall that one of the primary benefits of `summarize()` is that it facilitates grouped summaries. Well, we can still use those here!

```{r}
diet %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = retinol:zinc, 
                   .fns = mean))
```

Beautiful! So much information extracted so easily.

Here we grouped the data by age group, then across all the nutrient variables, we calculated their mean by age group. It can be read as: "for the 40-49 years old age group, the mean consumption of retinol is roughly of 1.343 micrograms, which seems lower than for other age groups."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see another example.

The columns from `is_drug_parac` to `is_drug_other` in the `yaounde` dataset indicate, as 1 or 0, whether or not a survey respondent was treated with the named drug:

```{r}
yao_drugs <- 
  yaounde %>% 
  select(age_years, sex, date_surveyed, is_drug_parac:is_drug_other)

yao_drugs
```

How could we count the number of respondents who took each drug?

We can simply take the sum of each column selecting the columns intelligently and using the `sum()` function:

```{r}
yao_drugs %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = starts_with("is_drug"), 
                   .fns = sum))
```

Oh no! we get all NAs!

We were smart and selected all our columns using `starts_with()` but we forgot to consider that `sum()` has `na.rm` set to `FALSE` by default. We need to ensure the `na.rm` argument is set to TRUE.

The best way to do this is with lambda/anonymous function syntax:

```{r}
yao_drugs %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = starts_with("is_drug"), 
                   .fns = ~ sum(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

Again, we could also create a grouped summary:

```{r}
yao_drugs %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = starts_with("is_drug"), 
                   .fns = ~ sum(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

This last code chunk counts the number of individuals, per sex (group by sex), who have received each drug (summing the number of people across each drug variable).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A final example.

Recall that the 13 columns from `symp_fever` to `symp_stomach_ache` in the `yao_symptoms` dataset indicate whether or not each respondent had a specific COVID-compatible symptom:

```{r}
yao_symptoms
```

How would we count the number of people with each symptom using `across()`.

We have two options.

Option 1: We could first `mutate()` the "Yes" and "No" to numeric values:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache, 
                   .fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", 1, 0)))
```

And then use `sum()` within `summarize()`:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache, 
                .fns = ~ if_else(.x == "Yes", 1, 0))) %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache, 
                   .fns = sum))
```

Option 2: we could jump directly to `summarize()`, by summing with a condition:

```{r}
yao_symptoms %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = symp_fever:symp_stomach_ache, 
                   .fns = ~ sum(.x == "Yes")))
```

This code can be read as: across each symptom column, sum all individuals who have been recorded as receiving that drug (who have a "Yes" data entry for that drug).

::: practice
In the `diet` data set, the variables `fao_fgw1` to `fao_fgw21` record the number of calories consumed from different FAO food groups. (FAO stands for "Food and Agricultural Organization"; the food groups are shown in Appendix 1.).

Use `summarize()` and `across()`, giving the `.fns` argument a lambda function to calculate the median. Careful ! A lambda function with the right arguments is indispensable, else you will have an `NA` median for some of the variables.

  yaounde %>%

:::

### Multiple summary statistics

When we explored `summarize()` we rejoiced with the fact that we could calculate multiple summary statistics at the same time. This is also possible within `across()`.

Coming back to the diet data survey from Vietnam, we could calculate both the mean and the median across all the nutrient variables:

```{r}
diet %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = retinol:zinc,
                   .fns = list(mean = mean, 
                               median = median)))
```

Here it is clear that on all numeric type variables of the data set, we want to calculate the mean and the median. We can do so by providing the `.fns` argument of `across()` with a list.

::: side-note
Small joke: `.fns` isn't "functions" abbreviated plural for nothing ! If we could only apply one function within `across()`, it would have been named `.fn` (function singular abbreviated).
:::

This time, for the naming, `across()` takes care of naming the resulting summary statistic columns. The syntax is : `list(desired_name_1 = function_1, desired_name_2 = function_2)`.

Let's see how you could control the naming even more, when operating on a list of functions:

```{r}
diet %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = retinol:zinc, 
                   .fns = list(average = mean, median = median),
                   .names = "{.fn}_{.col}"))
```

Here we reference the name of the function using `{.fn}` and the name of the column with `{.col}`. It is important to note that **both abbreviations are singular**! They are singular because they reference the function and the column one by one. Within the `across()` procedure, `across()` takes the functions and the columns one by one and for each one, takes the function name, such as `average`, and the column name, such as `retinol`, and makes the summary statistic `average_retinol` (i.e. `{.fn}`=`average` and `{.col}`=`retinol`).

As we are discussing mean, median, standard deviation calculations, we have to anticipate for `NA` values. Consider the code below:

```{r}
diet %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = retinol:zinc, 
                   .fns = list(average = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                               median = ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
                   .names = "{.fn}_{.col}"))
```

Here we have the same code as above, except we ensure that none of the means or medians will be `NA` by adding the `na.rm=TRUE` argument to the functions. For this, as we have seen above, we need to use the lambda/anonymous function style. Here we are giving the `.fns` argument a list of lambda functions.

::: practice
In the `diet` data set, calculate the mean and the standard deviation for kilocalories, water, carbohydrates, fat, and protein consumed (i.e. from the variable `kilocalories_consumed` to the variable `carbs_consumed_grams`)

Use `summarize()` and `across()`, giving the `.fns` argument a list of the desired summary statistics. Make sure your means are named `COLUMN_NAME_mean` and your standard deviations are named `COLUMN_NAME_sd`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_diet_food_composition_mean_sd <- 
  diet %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_diet_food_composition_mean_sd()
.HINT_Q_diet_food_composition_mean_sd()
```
:::

::: practice
In the `febrile_diseases` data set, calculate the mean and the standard deviation for white blood cells,and all other blood analysis measurements (i.e. from the variable `wbc` to the variable `relymp_a`, seeing Appendix 2 for the detailed names of the variable name abbreviations)

Use `summarize()` and `across()`, giving the `.fns` argument a list of the desired summary statistics. Careful ! You need to give a list of lambda functions to calculate the mean and standard deviation, paying attention to the `na.rm` arguments, else your summary statistics will be set to `NA`.

Make sure your means are named `COLUMN_NAME_mean` and your standard deviations are named `COLUMN_NAME_sd`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Q_febrile_diseases_mean_blood_composition <- 
  febrile_diseases %>%
  ____________________________
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
.CHECK_Q_febrile_diseases_mean_blood_composition()
.HINT_Q_febrile_diseases_mean_blood_composition()
```

## Recap !

`across()` can be used inside many different {dplyr} verbs:

-   `mutate(across(multiple_columns, function(s) to apply))`

-   `summarize(across(multiple_columns, function(s) to apply))`

The statement defining multiple columns can be:

-   a list of names e.g. `c(symp_fever, symp_headache, symp_cough)`

-   a range of names e.g. `retinol:zinc`

-   a condition: `!sex` OR `where(is.numeric)`

The function(s) to apply across all columns can be:

-   an existing function of R (such as `as.factor`, `mean` etc.)

-   a custom (lambda/anonymous) function

-   a list of existing functions (such as `list(mean = mean, sd = sd)`)

-   a list of custom (lambda/anonymous) functions

## Wrap up ! {.unnumbered}

This was your first approach to `across()`: congrats for making it through ! Remember the power of combination of `across()` and other verbs. If you feel a summarizing or mutation operation is identical for more than one variable, then usually you should think of using `across()`.

In the upcoming lessons we will see some more data wrangling verbs: see you soon !
